This game is based on a well-known analogy from mathematical optimization for describing certain local search algorithms (notably [gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) and [hill climb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing)). If our goal is to minimize the value of a cost function, then we can imagine that the objective is like a foggy mountain range and that our search process is a mountaineer trying to get down. Because of the fog the mountaineer's vision is limited, and so they have to make their decisions about which direction to move in based solely on their immediate surroundings.

This scenario struck me as one rife with horror potential, and I thought it would be kind of funny to try to make a horror game based on mathematical concepts. To help flesh things out there are also a few other... things... to discover on the mountain, based on a couple of local search-based [metaheuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic) that I've used during my [doctoral research](https://adam-rumpf.github.io/research.html).
